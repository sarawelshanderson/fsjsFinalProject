### H3 What it is
Code Louisville FSJS Final Project Grocery List App I wanted to create a simple re-usable shopping list. 

### H3 What it does
*The Grocery List for the user is displayed at the top.  
*When the user wants the item removed from the shopping list they select the "Got It!" button.  
*The user can go to the "Frequently Bought" list at the bottom and add the item to their shopping list by selecting the "Need It!" button.  
*Items can be added with the form at the bottom of the page. When an item is added it is automatically placed in the Shopping List.  
*Items can only be edited or deleted from the "Frequently Bought" list.  
*Data is stored on mLab.com.
