Code Louisville FSJS Final Project Grocery List App
I wanted to create a simple re-usable shopping list.  The Grocery List for the user is displayed at the top.  
When the user wants the item removed from the shopping list they select the "Got It!" button.
The user can go to the "Frequently Bought" list at the bottom and add the item to their shopping list by selecting the "Need It!" button.
Items can be added with the form at the bottom of the page.
When an item is added it is automatically placed in the Shopping List.
Items can only be edited or deleted from the "Frequently Bought" list.

Future work:
Sort the Shopping List and Frequently Bought list by category.
Make the Add Item a new page or pop up - or move button to top of page.
Character Limits on Item Category and Description.
Dropdown for categories.
Change categories to reference ID numbers so categories are more dynamic and manageable- prevent duplicates.

Future Future work:
Make intro page to allow user to select list type: grocery store, hardware store, wholesale club...
List stored locally so no username or password is needed.
