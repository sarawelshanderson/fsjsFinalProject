-------WHAT IT IS-------
Code Louisville FSJS Final Project Grocery List App I wanted to create a simple re-usable shopping list. 

-------WHAT IT DOES-------
The Grocery List for the user is displayed at the top.
When the user wants the item removed from the shopping list they select the "Got It!" button. 
The user can go to the "Frequently Bought" list at the bottom and add the item to their 
shopping list by selecting the "Need It!" button.
Items can be added with the form at the bottom of the page. When an item is added it is 
automatically placed in the Shopping List.
Items can only be edited or deleted from the "Frequently Bought" list.
Data is stored on mLab.com.

WHAT YOU Need-------

Run mongod-------
Run npm start-------
Open browser to: localhost:3030-------
